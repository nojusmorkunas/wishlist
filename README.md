## Features

- **Secret gift claiming**: Others can claim items on your list. You cannot see who claimed them.
- **Public share links**: Share a read-only list with people who do not have an account.
- **Per-item currency**: Each item can use its own currency. Your profile currency is used by default.
- **Photo uploads**: Add a photo to any item.
- **Product URL import**: Paste a product URL to auto-fill the name, description, price, and image.
- **Drag to reorder**: Move items into the order you want.
- **Priority levels**: Mark items as Low, Medium, or High priority.
- **Birthday countdowns**: See how many days are left until each person's next birthday.
- **Archive**: Move old items away from your active list without deleting them.
- **Received tracking**: Mark gifts as received after they arrive.
- **Admin panel**: Create users, reset passwords, and generate one-time signup links.
- **Simple deployment**: Runs as a single binary with SQLite. Docker is supported.
